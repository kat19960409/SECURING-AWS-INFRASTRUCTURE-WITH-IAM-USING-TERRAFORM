**🌟 Securing AWS Infrastructure with IAM Using Terraform 🌟**

Building secure and scalable cloud infrastructure is a critical component of modern IT operations. In this post, I’ll demonstrate how we can address common AWS security and architectural issues using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  

🚀 **Key Highlights**:  
1️⃣ **Improved Security with IAM Best Practices**:  
   - Avoid default security groups by defining restrictive security group rules.  
   - Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all users.  
   - Separate IAM roles and policies based on the principle of least privilege.  
   - Implement **strong password policies** and avoid sharing credentials in plaintext (e.g., team chat).  

2️⃣ **Enhanced Architecture**:  
   - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.  
   - Use RDS for user data instead of storing sensitive information in S3.  
   - Enable S3 versioning to prevent accidental data loss.  
   - Introduce a **NAT Gateway** for secure private subnet internet access.  

3️⃣ **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - Integrate **Amazon CloudWatch** for centralized logging and real-time insights.  


📌 **Why This Matters**:  
By automating infrastructure security with Terraform, we can:  
- Reduce manual effort.  
- Ensure compliance with security standards.  
- Accelerate deployments while maintaining robust protection for resources.
